    <p>The script of Whiplash was written by Damien Chazelle, who is also the director of “Whiplash”. Instead of being positive and inspirational like other homologous movies that encourage youth to persuade and fight for their dreams, the director used a dark, cruel and delirious tone to depict the extreme aspects of chasing dreams. The name “Whiplash” can be understood in two ways.  First, “Whiplash” is a technique(skill) of playing drums, which is throwing arms and drumsticks out like a whip, and pumping the rim and the drumhead with about half of drumsticks at the same time. Or “Whiplash” can also be a metaphor for Fletcher(the teacher in the movie)’s training methods.</p>

	<p>The character that impressed me the most is the supporting role, Fletcher. One day, when Andrew, is a 19 years old boy who is ambitious and wants to be the world’s greatest jazz drummer, was practicing in school, Fletcher, the music coach, and is also the people who changed Andrew’s life completely, came by and recruited him in his Big Band Jazz . From then on, Fletcher begins his inhuman training to Andrew. Under the pressure of Fletcher and also the pressure from himself, he trained himself in an irregular and brutal way and gradually got isolated from the world. No one understood him, only his tutor Fletcher does. But also, the irritable temper and moodiness of Fletcher distorted their relationship and influenced Andrew in different aspects. The over devotion for music makes Andrew lost his original faith for music. The mental and physical pressure gave by Fletcher made him challenged his ultimate limit frenziedly and gradually enveloped into a crazy showdown between him and Fletcher with the betting of life.</p>
